# Amstrad CPC MACHINE CODE
Particular exercises and completed challenges of the Retroman Program


I expose here are the challenges and some particular exercises done by me and some reasoning of how these results were reached. 
It is a program that can be found on the channel https://www.youtube.com/@ProfesorRetroman/about and you can also get the base 
program at the web link https://profesorretroman.com/ with a complete machine language course and assembler on Z80. All executable 
files are in binary format and are executed in winape. If you want to install and test the binary, here is the video supported by the CPCtelera community (UBUNTU) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aItoD7OfdkM, (MAC OSX) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a_dh0WXWic and (WINDOWS) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIrbPEinYp0&list=RDCMUCSdIAKvPxlB3VlFDCBvI46A&index=3
