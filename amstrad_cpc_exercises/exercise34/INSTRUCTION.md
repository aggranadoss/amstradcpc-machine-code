All code is placed (or pasted) at position 4000. Many times in machine code there is a tendency towards spaghetti code, but the results in machine speed are impressive. The PC or Program Counter starts at 4300, set all values to zero. And start Winape. Attached a video for the result of its operation and they can also be seen in the results.gif file on github.

The images of the codes to insert them are:
